# Task tracking
## Description
A simple task tracking REST API with a basic crud functionality and more.

In this pet project I've experimented with JPA relationships, added some business logic,
implemented task search by filter via QueryDSL.

There are some business logic added (e.g. Project cannot be closed if not all task in status 'DONE')
